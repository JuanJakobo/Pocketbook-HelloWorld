# Pocketbook Hello World 

## How to Setup

First you need to install the basic build tools for linux.

Then you must run to set up cmake.

`cmake .`

To build the application based on the current code you can run the makearm script.

`./makearm.sh` 



## Where to go on

A very good tutorial how to set up GDB and program small function is https://github.com/pmartin/pocketbook-demo.

### Tested on
* Pocketbook HD3 (PB623) (V. U623.6.0.926)

## Usage

Once the application is build it can be copied to the Pocketbook to finally use it. 
Therefore you have to copy the file "HelloWorld.app" which is placed in the bin folder to the application folder of the PB.
The App then is placed under User. It simply offers an empty screen. When you click on the screen an star appears. 

## Disclamer

Use as your own risk! 
Even though the possibility is really low, the application could harm your device or even break it.
